<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve noticed a few cases where I&rsquo;ve been solving a problem and determined that some approach doesn&rsquo;t work, only to get stuck on other approaches too and finally return to the supposedly broken approach and realize that it actually works. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll explicitly set out to rewrite a piece of broken code using the same approach and it&rsquo;ll work and I can compare the two, but for most problems the history will be gone and I&rsquo;m left wondering what I was doing wrong before.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t only happen for programming problems, either. I was searching through my journal looking for something else yesterday and happened to see an unsuccessful skin-care regime I undertook about a year ago. It called for the use of two products and I followed it for a week but it worsened my skin&rsquo;s condition so much that I stopped. A few months ago I started using one of the products alone, having completely forgotten about my prior experience, and it proved super effective. I likely could have seen those results a year earlier if I&rsquo;d changed one variable at a time and hadn&rsquo;t conflated the failure of the combo with the failure of each individually.</p>
<p>These false negatives for good approaches aren&rsquo;t surprising: I fail to solve many problems on the first try even when I&rsquo;m using an approach that&rsquo;s been shown by others to work. And when it&rsquo;s unclear why something is broken, as it often is, it&rsquo;s easy to get the impression that the approach is hopeless without having enough information to confidently rule it out. The best strategy I can think of to mitigate the cost of these false negatives is to take better notes. I often take notes of the approaches I&rsquo;m trying, but clearly I need to be more disciplined in noting why I abandon an approach as well so I can judge later whether I did so mistakenly.</p>
